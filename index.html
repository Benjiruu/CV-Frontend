            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Tom Cruise. I am an actor from Syracuse, New York, and I have been a part of the entertainment industry for over four decades. My career has spanned various genres, from action and adventure to drama and science fiction. I am known for performing my own stunts and for my dedication to my craft. Apart from acting, I have a passion for aviation and hold a pilot's license. I also founded the Tom Cruise Foundation, which supports various charitable causes around the world.
